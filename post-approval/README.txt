== Description ==

The system we're creating will manage the life cycle of posts, of any kind. When a post is submitted, it will be in draft status until an assigned editor approves it. To ensure fairness, submitted posts will be assigned to editors in a way that each editor gets an equal amount of assignments.


A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.



    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `post-approval folder` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1.1 Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
